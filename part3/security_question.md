Some possible security issues that I would look for in the system:

Broken Access Control: The OWASP Top 10ยน ranks this as the most significant online application security issue. For every request, especially one involving sensitive information or functionality, you should make sure that your system performs the appropriate authorization checks. Strong authentication techniques like multi-factor authentication, password hashing, and session management should also be used. Based on their jobs and duties, you should restrict your employees' access rights. You should also keep an eye on their activities to spot any unusual activity.

Cryptographic Failures: Based on the OWASP Top 101, this is the second most dangerous online application security issue. To safeguard your data while it's in transit and at rest, utilize safe, current cryptographic libraries and algorithms. Additionally, you must to generate, store, and rotate keys in a secure manner, as per recommended by best practices for key management. Any sensitive information, including passwords, API keys, and tokens, should not be revealed in plain text or in log files.

Injection: According to the OWASP Top 101, injection is the third most dangerous online application security vulnerability. You should stop any malicious input from being used as a query or command in your system. To communicate with your database, you should utilize prepared statements, stored procedures, or parameterized queries. All user input should also be verified, cleaned, and encoded before being shown to the user. It is important for you to understand the many kinds of injection threats, including cross-site scripting (XSS), SQL injection, and command injection.

Insecure design: A new category for 2021, "Insecure Design" focuses on the dangers associated with design defects1. Applying defense-in-depth, least-privilege, and fail-safe design concepts to your system architecture and its constituent parts is a good idea. To find and address any risks and weaknesses in your system, you need also carry out threat modeling and risk assessment. The reference architectures and secure design patterns that are pertinent to the technology stack and domain of your system should be followed.

Security Misconfiguration: OWASP Top 101 ranks this as the fifth most critical online application security issue. It is recommended that you configure your system securely by adhering to the security recommendations and best practices specific to your platform and framework. Additionally, you ought to regularly apply the most recent security updates and patches to your machine. Any superfluous features, services, or accounts that could leave your system vulnerable to assaults should be disabled or deleted. Additionally, you want to fortify your system against typical attacks like denial-of-service (DoS) and brute force attacks by utilizing secure defaults.

Vulnerable and Outdated Components: The OWASP Top 101 ranks this as the sixth most serious web application security risk. Only dependable and validated parts for your system, like modules, frameworks, and libraries, should be used. Along with routinely updating and monitoring your components, you should also replace any that are known to be vulnerable or that are no longer supported. In order to manage and keep track of your dependencies and ensure their authenticity and integrity, you should also employ procedures and tools.

Failed Authentication and Identification: This is a new category for 2021 that focuses on risks associated with user authentication and identification1. Strong and secure methods, like federated identity, passwordless authentication, and biometric authentication, should be put in place for confirming the identity and credentials of your users. Additionally, you should guard against unauthorized access to your users' accounts and sessions, such as phishing, account takeover, and session hijacking. Additionally, you ought to provide users the option to control their own accounts, including changing passwords, turning on two-factor authentication, and removing access tokens.

Software and Data Integrity Failures: This is a brand-new category for 2021 that focuses on threats to your software and data's availability and integrity1. Make sure your system is capable of identifying and stopping any malicious or unauthorized changes, like tampering, corruption, or deletion, to your data or software. In the event of a catastrophe or an attack, you should also put backup and recovery procedures in place to return your system to a known good state. Checksums, digital signatures, and encryption are other important tools to use to confirm the authenticity and integrity of your data and software.

Security Logging: According to the OWASP Top 101, security logging and monitoring failures rank as the ninth most serious web application security risk. For your system, you should put in place efficient and thorough logging and monitoring features, like performance metrics, audit logs, and error logs. Regularly reviewing and analyzing your logs and metrics is also advised. You should also be on the lookout for any anomalies or incidents that might point to a security breach or an attack. It is imperative that you maintain the retention of your logs and metrics for an adequate duration and safeguard them against any unauthorized access or alteration.

Server Side Request Forgery: According to the OWASP Top 101, server-side request forgery ranks as the tenth most dangerous web application security risk. Any malicious or accidental requests to internal or external resources, like web servers, APIs, or databases, should be stopped by your system. In addition, you ought to verify and cleanse any user-supplied URLs or parameters that are utilized in requests, and employ whitelists or blacklists to regulate the protocols and destinations that are permitted or prohibited. To keep your system separate from untrusted networks or hosts, you should also use firewalls and secure network configurations.
